              Our event is hosted to help spread. Harry smiled weakly. Yes,
              trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but
              he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching.
              The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didnâ€™t feel brave
              or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had
              mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would
              have been the one for him.
